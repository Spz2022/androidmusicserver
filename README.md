## What is this?


Kevin's Music Server for Android provides a web browser interface to
control playback of audio files stored on relatively modern (4.x-9.0) 
Android devices. 
This allows the Android device
to be used as a music server, in multi-room audio applications, among
other things. 

Audio tracks can be selected using a browser from a list of albums, or
directly from the filesystem (but see notes below). 
You can restrict the album listing to particular
genres or particular artists rather than displaying all 
albums on the same page. Album cover
art images can be displayed (but see notes below about this, too).

The browser user interface looks like this:

While the app itself (which will probably never be used, apart from
starting and stopping it) looks like this:

<h1>Kevin's Music Server for Android </h1>

Version 0.0.1.

<h2>What is this?</h2>


<img src="androidmusicserverscreenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="400" align="left" style="margin-right:30px"/>

Kevin's Music Server for Android provides a web browser interface to
control playback of audio stored on relatively modern (4.x) Android devices. 
This allows the Android device
to be used as a music server, in multi-room audio applications, among
other things. It is a cut-down version of <a href="kmediad_server">kmediad</a>,
which supports similar operations on Linux and Windows.
<p/>
This app provides only very rudimentary features at present: 
audio tracks can be selected from a list of albums, or
directly from the filesystem.  

<h2>Installation</h2>

Download the APK package from the Downloads section at the
end of this page, copy it to your Android
device, and install it using any file manager. Or simply download the APK
directly from this page using your device's Web browser.  You may have to tell
your device to allow non-market apps. Android Music Server 
won't ever be appearing on
the Android Market, because I can't afford to pay Google to host stuff that I'm
giving away for free. Alternatively, if you're worried that this app might
transmit all your secret passwords to villains, you're welcome to inspect
and build from source (source code is also in the Downloads section).

<h2>Operation</h2>

This app is designed to run quietly in the background, so it 
has no substantive Android user interface. When you start it,
if all is well you'll see the URL to which you should point your web browser.
If there are problems, which will generally be WIFI-related, you'll
see an error message. There is also a "Stop" button which does what it says.
<p/>
All real operation of the app is from a Web browser. I hope that the
browser interface is relatively self-explanatory -- just select an
album from the list and click "Play now", or "Add" to append the
tracks to the playlist. Alternatively, click the "Files" link at
the bottom of the page and navigate
the filesystem to find some audio files.
<p/>
You can operate Android Music Server using a web browser on the device
itself (if the browser has adequate JavaScript support); but the app
is really intended to be operaed from a browser on a different machine. 
<p/>
Android Music Server responds to remote control events -- from
a bluetooth headset with control buttons, for example. In particular,
it responds to play, pause, step, next track, and previous track events.
Of course, for next track and previous track to work, there must be
something in the playlist. 


<h2>Notes</h2>

The web interface is completely stateless; that is, everything it
needs to know is captured in the URL supplied by the browser. So
you can
freely bookmark albums or filesystem locations in the browser. 
<p/>
When browsing the filesystem, you can add files one at a time to the playlist, 
or add the directory that
contains them. The app will filter out playable audio files from other
types, so it should be OK to click "Add" on a directory with mixed content.
Note that the Add function in a directory only searches that specific
directory -- it won't descend into subdirectories.
<p/>
There's no general agreement between Android device vendors about where
media data gets stored. On most devices, internal storage will be
in <code>/sdcard/Music</code> or <code>/sdcard/Audio</code>, but this
is not universal. The filesystem location of external SD cards is
even less standardized. On Samsung devices, <code>/storage/exSdCard</code>
is a good place to start.
<p/>
If you connect a Bluetooth audio device (e.g., headset) whilst this app is
playing (through speaker or wired headphones), then audio should automatically
be diverted to the headset. However, you might need to stop the app, 
or at least stop playback, to route audio back to the speaker. This slightly
odd behaviour is, so far as I know, not a feature of this program -- other
Android media players behave the same way. 
<p/>
The browser interface updates every five seconds, so don't expect
mouse-clicks to be reflected immediately in the browser (although,
of course, they should have immediate effect on the audio). This
five-second update time is to reduce load on the Android device.
<p/>
If you click "Play now" on a track whilst an item in the playlist is being
played, then playback will resume at the next playlist item when playback
of the selected track finishes, if there is anything left to play in 
the playlist.
<p/>
You can control the volume of playback using the "Vol up" and "Vol down"
links at the bottom of the page. If you're using a headset, that might
have its own volume control and, if it does, it probably sets the
volume on the headset itself, not on the device.
<p/>
Browsing the filesystem will probably be completely useless if you're the kind
of person who dumps thousands of music files into a single folder, and relies
on the device to order them by tags. You'll just see a page listing thousands
of files, and you won't be able to find anything.
<p/>
Similarly, browing by album is only helpful if your audio files have
album tags, and the device's media scanner is enabled and working correctly.
<p/>
Not a feature of this app, but it's helpful to know that some folders that
contain media can be removed from the oversight of the Android media scanner
by creating an empty file called <code>.nomedia</code> in those directories.
This can be useful for preventing ringtones and the like from appearing
in the album list; but bear in mind that this trick affects all apps
that use the media scanner.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

At present, only album or file/directory browsing is provided. In future I hope
to support listing by artist, composer, genre, etc.
<p/>
Some Android devices are factory-configured to prevent <i>any</i>
incoming network connection. Sorry but, without rooting the device,
there's no way to change that, and this app simply won't work.
Similarly, if your Android implementation shuts down the WiFi radio
to save power when the screen blanks, this app won't work.
<p/>
The album list is presented as a single page. In practice this seems to
be unproblematic with up to a few hundred albums. With huge numbers
of albums, building the albums list might be a bit slow. 
<p/>
Android Media Server relies heavily on JavaScript to create and manage its
web user interface. Your browser needs decent JavaScript support --
the browser on the android device itself might not be up to the job
(but Chrome, at least, seems to work pretty well.) 
<p/>
Only WIFI operation is supported -- you won't be able to connect to the
app over a mobile network. Even if the app allowed this, most likely
the service would not.
<p/>
The app will not respond very well to changes in WIFI status -- if you
change access points, for example -- and you'll probably need to restart
it in such cases.
<p/>
Android Music Server relies for its tag (e.g., album) 
support entirely on the Android
media scanner. If this isn't working (which is relatively common), 
results will be variable. The app queries the media scanner only 
when it starts, so media added after starting may not be visible (even
if the scanner is working).  
<p/>
One particular oddity of the Android media scanner, is that it will sometimes 
present video files as 'Music,' presmumably because they have sountracks.
This app doesn't play video, so these entries in the album list are an
irritation.
<p/>
Whilst you can skip forward and back between tracks in the playlist,
there is no general foward/rewind facility within a specific
track. This is a tricky thing to implement within a web interface.
<p/>
At present, the app listens on port 8080, and that can't be changed.
<p/>
There is quite a subtle limitation inherent in the way 
Android audio works. Android Music Server registers itself to receive
remote control events (e.g., from a headset), but <i>only when audio
is playing</i>. So you can select play/pause, next track, and previous 
track, if your headset has buttons for these functions. However,
if you do a "stop" operation (if your hardware supports it), you
won't be able to start again, or use remote control at all,
until you resume playback using the web interface. The reason this limitation
exists is that the app is designed to run in the background, and perhaps
be idle a lot of the time. If it took over the remote control when it 
was running, it would prevent other media apps using the remote control.
There are, in fact, a number of popular media players that suffer from
this exact problem, and it can be quite a nuisance.
<p/>
The user interface is currently English-language only.
<p/>
The part of Android Music Server that responds to HTTP requests and plays
audio (i.e., most of it) is implemented as an Android background service.
It is therefore less prone to automatic unloading than the user interface
is. It's possible that Android might unload the user interface, whilst
leaving the service running. This should be harmless, because when you
restart the app, Android will not restart the service if it is still
running. It's possible, in conditions of low memory, that Android will
unload the service as well. In that case, Android is supposed to reload
it when conditions improve, without user intervention. That process should
also be transparent to the user except that, of course, whilst unloaded
the service will not respond to HTTP requests. However, if the service
is unloaded and reloading in this way, it will reinitialize, and 
the current playlist will be lost.


<h2>Disclaimer, etc</h2>
I wrote Android Music Server server for my own use; I'm 
publishing it in case somebody
else might get some benefit from it -- even if it's only to look at the source
code and see how not to write an Android app. It might work for you, it
might not. If it doesn't, you're very welcome to fix it. There is, as you
might expect, no warranty of any kind.

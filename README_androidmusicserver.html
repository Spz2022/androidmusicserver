<h1>Kevin's Music Server for Android </h1>

Version 0.0.3.

<h2>What is this?</h2>


<img src="androidmusicserverscreenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="400" align="left" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px"/>

Kevin's Music Server for Android provides a web browser interface to
control playback of audio files stored on relatively modern (4.x) 
Android devices. 
This allows the Android device
to be used as a music server, in multi-room audio applications, among
other things. It is a cut-down version of <a href="kmediad_server">kmediad</a>,
which supports similar operations on Linux and Windows.
<p/>
Audio tracks can be selected using a browser from a list of albums, or
directly from the filesystem. You can restrict the album listing to particular
genres or particular artists rather than displaying all 
albums on the same page. Album cover
art images can be displayed (but see notes below about this.)

<h2>Installation</h2>

Download the APK package from the Downloads section at the
end of this page, copy it to your Android
device, and install it using any file manager. Or simply download the APK
directly from this page using your device's Web browser.  You may have to tell
your device to allow non-market apps. Android Music Server 
won't ever be appearing on
the Android Market, because I can't afford to pay Google to host stuff that I'm
giving away for free. Alternatively, if you're worried that this app might
transmit all your secret passwords to villains, you're welcome to inspect
and build the application yourself (source code is also in the 
Downloads section), or from <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/androidmusicserver">github</a>.

<br clear="all"/>
<h2>Operation</h2>

<img src="androidmusicserverscreenshot2.png" alt="screenshot" width="400" align="right" style="margin-left:30px"/>

This app is designed to run quietly in the background, so it 
has no substantive Android user interface. When you start it,
if all is well you'll see the URL to which you should point your web browser.
If there are problems, which will generally be WIFI-related, you'll
see an error message. The app displays some information about the audio
track that is currently playing, if there is one, and provides some
buttons to control playback, in a rudimentary way. The "Shutdown" button
shuts the application down completely, including its background
service.
<p/>
All real operation of the app is from a Web browser. I hope that the
browser interface is relatively self-explanatory -- just select an
album from one of the various lists and click "Play now", or "Add" 
to append the
tracks to the playlist. Alternatively, click the "Files" link at
the bottom of the page and navigate
the filesystem to find some audio files. Or just click "Random" to
play a randomly-selected album.
<p/>
You can operate Android Music Server using a web browser on the device
itself (if the browser has adequate JavaScript support); but the app
is really intended to be operated from a browser on a different machine.
It is intended for remote control of music playback; there are many 
good media players for on-device operation.
<p/>
Android Music Server responds to remote control events -- from
a bluetooth headset with control buttons, for example. In particular,
it responds to play, pause, step, next track, and previous track events.
Of course, for next track and previous track to work, there must be
something in the playlist.

<h2>Notes</h2>

This application is intended to work with relatively modest
collections of audio files, that are relatively tidily organized. 
All lists (of albums, artists, etc) are displayed on a single,
possibly long page. In practice it seems to work reasonably well
with collections of a few hundred albums, but the user interface
will struggle with thousands of albums. 
<p/>
In general this app assumes
(as Android generally does) that audio tracks are organized into
albums, and that at least the album, title, and artist tags are
filled in. To play an album in the right order it also assumes that
the track number tag is filled in, or that the titles when arranged
into alphabetical order will give the same ordering as the original
album. Everything about this application will work somewhat better
if files are thoroughly and consistently tagged -- but that's true
of most music players. I'm told that "free music downloaders"
(bootlegging utilities, in other words) do not fill in tags properly,
and you can end up with two thousand tracks in the same album, all
called "null". If you sup with the Devil, as the saying goes,
use a long spoon.
<p/>
The web interface is completely stateless; that is, everything it
needs to know is captured in the URL supplied by the browser. So
you can
freely bookmark albums, or artists, or filesystem locations. 
<p/>
When browsing the filesystem, you can add files one at a time to the playlist, 
or add the directory that
contains them. The app will filter out playable audio files from other
types, so it should be OK to click "Add" on a directory with mixed content.
Note that the Add function in a directory only searches that specific
directory -- it won't descend into subdirectories.
<p/>
There's no general agreement between Android device vendors about where
media data gets stored. On most devices, internal storage will be
in <code>/sdcard/Music</code> or <code>/sdcard/Audio</code>, but this
is not universal. The filesystem location of external SD cards is
even less standardized. On Samsung devices, <code>/storage/exSdCard</code>
is a good place to start.
<p/>
If you connect a Bluetooth audio device (e.g., headset) whilst this app is
playing (through speaker or wired headphones), then audio should automatically
be diverted to the headset. However, you might need to stop the app, 
or at least stop playback, to route audio back to the speaker. This slightly
odd behaviour is, so far as I know, not a feature of this program -- other
Android media players behave the same way. 
<p/>
The browser interface updates every five seconds, so don't expect
mouse-clicks to be reflected immediately in the browser (although,
of course, they should have immediate effect on the audio). This
five-second update time is to reduce load on the Android device.
<p/>
If you click "Play now" on a track whilst an item in the playlist is being
played, then playback will resume at the next playlist item when playback
of the selected track finishes, if there is anything left to play in 
the playlist.
<p/>
You can control the volume of playback by clicking on the loudspeaker
buttons in the menu bar at the top of each page, or by going to the
"Equalizer, etc" page from the home page, and tweaking the volume
slider.  
If you're using a headset, that might
have its own volume control and, if it does, it probably sets the
volume on the headset itself, not on the device. So, in that case, 
to get full volume you probably need to turn up the volume both on
the headset and in this application.
<p/>
Browsing the filesystem will probably be completely useless if you're the kind
of person who dumps thousands of music files into a single folder, and relies
on the device to order them by tags. You'll just see a page listing thousands
of files, and you won't be able to find anything. Browsing by album should
still be fine (but see note below about cover art.)
<p/>
Not a feature of this app, but it's helpful to know that some folders that
contain media can be removed from the oversight of the Android media scanner
by creating an empty file called <code>.nomedia</code> in those directories.
This can be useful for preventing ringtones and the like from appearing
in the album list; but bear in mind that this trick affects all apps
that use the media scanner.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

The are particular issues regarding the display of cover art: please
see the section "Cover art" below.
<p/>
Some Android devices are factory-configured to prevent <i>any</i>
incoming network connection. Sorry but, without rooting the device,
there's no way to change that, and this app simply won't work.
Similarly, if your Android implementation shuts down the WiFi radio
to save power when the screen blanks then, again, this app won't work.
<p/>
Android Media Server relies heavily on JavaScript to create and manage its
web user interface. Your browser needs decent JavaScript support --
the browser on the android device itself might not be up to the job
(but Chrome, at least, seems to work pretty well.) 
<p/>
Only WIFI operation is supported -- you won't be able to connect to the
app over a mobile network. Even if the app allowed this, most likely
the service would not.
<p/>
The app will not respond very well to changes in WIFI status -- if you
change access points, for example -- and you'll probably need to restart
it in such cases.
<p/>
Android Music Server relies for its tag (e.g., album) 
support entirely on the Android
media scanner. If this isn't working (which is relatively common), 
results will be variable. The app queries the media scanner
when it starts, so media added after starting may not be visible (even
if the scanner is working), unless you click the "Rescan media catalogue"
link in the home page. Please see the section 'Android media 
catalogue issues' for more information. 
<p/>
One particular oddity of the Android media scanner is that it will sometimes 
present video files as 'Music,' presmumably because they have soundtracks.
This app doesn't play video, so these entries in the album list are an
irritation.
<p/>
Whilst you can skip forward and back between tracks in the playlist,
there is no general foward/rewind facility within a specific
track. This is a tricky thing to implement within a web interface.
<p/>
At present, the app listens on port 30000, and that can't be changed.
<p/>
There is quite a subtle limitation inherent in the way 
Android audio works. Android Music Server registers itself to receive
remote control events (e.g., from a headset), but <i>only when audio
is playing</i>. So you can select play/pause, next track, and previous 
track, if your headset has buttons for these functions. However,
if you do a "stop" operation (if your hardware supports it), you
won't be able to start again, or use remote control at all,
until you resume playback using the web interface. The reason this limitation
exists is that the app is designed to run in the background, and perhaps
be idle a lot of the time. If it took over the remote control when it 
was running, it would prevent other media apps using the remote control.
There are, in fact, a number of popular media players that suffer from
this exact problem, and it can be quite a nuisance.
<p/>
This application is, in essence, an unsecured web server. It does allow
people on the same WIFI network to browse the contents of the device's
storage -- at least those parts of it that contain audio. The application
is not really intended for use in hostile environments. 
<p/>
The user interface is currently English-language only.
<p/>
The part of Android Music Server that responds to HTTP requests and plays
audio (i.e., most of it) is implemented as an Android background service.
It is therefore less prone to automatic unloading than the user interface
is. It's possible that Android might unload the user interface, whilst
leaving the service running. This should be harmless, because when you
restart the app, Android will not restart the service if it is still
running. It's possible, in conditions of low memory, that Android will
unload the service as well. In that case, Android is supposed to reload
it when conditions improve, without user intervention. That process should
also be transparent to the user except that, of course, whilst unloaded
the service will not respond to HTTP requests. However, if the service
is unloaded and reloading in this way, it will reinitialize, and 
the current playlist will be lost.
<p/>
The Android API specifies an interface by which app can control audio equalizer
settings, but manufacturers do not have to implement it in any useful way.
That is, the controls may not be connected to anything. "Bass boost" is
particularly flakey -- on some devices it has an adjustable strength, 
on some it is just an on/off control, and on some it has no effect at all.
Devices that provide their own, vendor-specific audio enhancers frequently
do not implement the Android audio API at all.
In any event, I am aware of few Android devices where the stock equalizer really
works well. 

<h2>Cover art</h2>

If you choose to browse albums including covers, then the
app will attempt to find some cover art to display. The places it
looks are as follows.
<p/>
First, the app will ask the Android media catalogue if any track in
the specified album has an embedded image. If it does, then the first
track that can provide an image does so. In practice, the Android media
catalogue seems to be limited to returning "baked in" images, that is,
images that are part of an ID3 tag or similar.
<p/>
Second, the app will look in the directory that contains the track file, for
an image file that looks like it might contain cover art. At present, it
considers files names <code>folder</code> or <code>cover</code>, perhaps
with a leading "." (hidden files), and with extensions <code>jpg</code>
or <code>png</code>. These names are in lower-case only. Naturally,
this process will only produce good results if folders contain tracks
from the same album only.
<p/>
The cover art extraction process is
subject to a number of limitations.
<ul>
<li>
Baked-in cover-art images can be quite large -- perhaps even photo-sized.
Returning all the images on a page containing, say, a list of two hundred
albums is a challenge for an Android device. If the browser is also on a
mobile device, then the challenge is compounded. The music server therefore
attempts to avoid sending images if it can avoid doing so. It sets
an <code>Expires</code> header one hour in the future for all images, 
and sets a
<code>Last-Modified </code>header on all images based on the time the 
app starts up. In
principle, therefore, the browser should not request images very 
frequently. But...
</li>
<li>
Mobile browsers in particular are often stupid when it comes to
handling date headers. Many ignore them completely, and just blindly
request all images in every page. Apart from choosing to browse without
covers, there's little that can be done to avoid this problem, if you
have a stupid browser.
</li>
<li>
We don't know the actual last-modified time of a baked-in cover image. The
music server uses its start-up time as the modification baseline, lacking
any better information. What this means is that if you restart the app
whilst the browser still has images in its cache, the browser will get
confused: because the image has a last-modified date in the future, but
in the browser's cache it has not yet expired.
Clearing the browser cache usually fixes this
problem. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Genre support</h2>

Android Music Server provides a list of genres, to restrict the listing of
albums to specific genres. Needless to say, for this to work the audio
files must have valid genre tags.
<p/>
Querying the Android media catalogue for genre information is 
<i>excruciatingly</i>
slow. I believe that there is some problem with the internal search
 implementation,
which seems to require the whole genre catalogue to be expanded into tracks
and then a query run against each track. Whatever the reason, with large
numbers of tracks (more than a few hundred) some short-cuts have to be
taken. The application therefore assumes that each track in an album has
the same genre and, when searching which albums match a genre, only the
first track is checked. Of course, it's not all that unusual for 
different tracks to have different genres in the same album, but testing
them all is simply unfeasibly slow.
<p/>
Genres that have no associated tracks are silently ignored.

<h2>Artist support</h2>

When an entry is selected from the Artist list, any album that contains
at least one track attributed to that artist is included in the 
album list. That is, an album doesn't have to be limited to a single
artist to be included in that artist's listing. 
<p/>
It's not at all uncommon for an album to contain tracks by many different
artists. If many albums are of that type, the artist list could be very 
long.


<h2>Playlist operations</h2>

On the Playlist page you can shuffle or clear the playlist, if 
it is not empty. Clicking either of the relevant links causes the
page to refresh but, because the HTTP requests made using JavaScript
are asynchronous, it can't be guaranteed that the playlist has changed
on the server before the page is refreshed. You might need to refresh
the page explicitly if changes to the playlist do not show up
immediately. 
<p/>
Shuffling only changes the order in which items appear in the playlist --
if something is playing when you shuffle, the change in ordering will
only be apparent when that track is finished.

<h2>Android media catalogue issues</h2>

Android maintains a catalogue of media files and their metadata (tags).
When a file is added using a USB connection, or presented to the
device on an SD card or similar, Android reads the metadata and updates
the catalogue. Android Music Server relies entirely on this catalogue
for information about albums, artists, etc. Two problems affect this
application's use of the media catalogue.
<p/>
First, the application has to scan the catalogue to get lists of
albums, artists, etc., for the display. This process is not usually
very time-consuming, but not something that we want to do regularly.
In principle, the music server could hook into the media scanner and
rescan every time a file is added or deleted, but many files will be of
no interest to the application (documents, pictures), and rescanning
like this could be overzealous. Instead, there is a link on the 
home page 'Rescan the media catalog.' This will cause the music server
to rebuild its own lists of albums, artists, etc., from Android's catalogue.
Of course, you could just restart the app.
<p/>
The second problem is that the media catalogue can sometimes get 
out-of-sync with the contents of storage. This isn't usually a problem
with files added by USB, but can be a problem with files on removeable
storage devices, and is particularly a problem if files are moved
around using a general file manager (or, worse, at a command prompt,
although most users probably won't do that). 
<p/>
The link 'Rescan the filesystem' will ask Android to start a complete
rescan of the filesystem. Android is completely at liberty to 
ignore this request and, in later versions, is increasingly willing to.
With Android 5, rebooting may be the only way to force a complete
rescan. Note that the Music Server user interface will not wait
for the rescan, and rescanning the filesystem does not imply rescanning
the media catalogue (because we have no way to know when the filesystem
rescan is finished, if it even started.)
